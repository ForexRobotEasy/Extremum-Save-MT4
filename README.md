# Extremum Save MT4 - Trading Robot

This is a trading robot developed by the Forex Robot Easy Team. It is designed to trade the EURUSD currency pair using predefined entry and exit conditions. The robot includes risk management techniques, position management, and real-time updates on trade performance.

## How it works

### Libraries and Constants
The necessary libraries are included at the beginning of the code. The `Trade` library is used for managing trades, and the `Math` library is used for mathematical calculations. Constants are defined for the symbol to trade (`SYMBOL`), stop loss value (`STOP_LOSS`), and risk percentage per trade (`RISK_PERCENTAGE`). The position size is calculated based on the account balance and risk percentage.

### Entry and Exit Conditions
The `ShouldEnter()` function is used to define the entry conditions for placing a trade. The logic for the entry conditions should be implemented within this function. In the provided code, the function always returns true, indicating that a trade should be entered.

The `ShouldExit()` function is used to define the exit conditions for closing a trade. The logic for the exit conditions should be implemented within this function. In the provided code, the function always returns false, indicating that a trade should not be exited.

### Placing Orders
The `PlaceOrder()` function is responsible for placing a buy order based on the predefined entry conditions. It gets the current ask price (`entryPrice`) and calculates the stop loss value. It then uses the `OrderSend()` function to place the buy order with the calculated position size, entry price, stop loss, and other parameters. If the order is placed successfully, a success message is printed; otherwise, a failure message is printed.

### Exiting Trades
The `ExitTrades()` function is called to check if a trade should be exited based on the predefined exit conditions. If the exit conditions are met, the `Trade.PositionClose()` function is used to close the buy order. If the order is closed successfully, a success message is printed; otherwise, a failure message is printed.

### Managing Positions
The `ManagePositions()` function is responsible for managing trade positions, including trailing stop and partial closing. It checks if the buy order is still active and gets the current bid price (`currentPrice`). If the current price is higher than the stop loss value, it calculates a new trailing stop value and sets it using the `Trade.PositionSetDouble()` function. The logic for partial closing can be implemented within this function.

### Risk Management
The `RiskManagement()` function is called to implement risk management techniques. The logic for position sizing and risk per trade should be implemented within this function.

### Update Trade Performance
The `UpdateTradePerformance()` function is responsible for providing real-time updates on trade performance and account balance. The logic for updating trade performance should be implemented within this function.

### OnTick Event
The `OnTick()` function is the entry point of the program and is called on every tick. It calls the `RiskManagement()` function to implement risk management techniques. If the entry conditions (`ShouldEnter()`) are met, it calls the `PlaceOrder()` function to place a buy order. It then calls the `ExitTrades()`, `ManagePositions()`, and `UpdateTradePerformance()` functions to manage trades and update trade performance.
